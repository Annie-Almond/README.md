I was recently employed by T-Mobile where I was a Senior Technical Learning and Development Trainer with 21 years of dedicated service.  Prior to entering the Wireless Industry supporting mobile broadband and devices I had earned an AAS from OSU-OKC with Major: Network Administration and Webpage Design. I have freelanced for a Domain Provider working directly with clients writing HTML + JavaScript webpages and manage the client web domain directories.  My current hobbies include: Beekeeping (5 Bee Hives at present), Gardening Veggies and Pollinator flowers and Bass Fishing.  I have an open mind and I'm willing to work hard as a OK coder student as I refresh and addon to my programming skills.
